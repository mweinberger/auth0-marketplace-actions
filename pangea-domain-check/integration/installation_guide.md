Pangea is a collection of security services, all API-based, that can quickly and easily be added to any cloud application, embedded in the runtime code. Pangea provides app builders with a wide selection of security services so they can easily embed security into their application. It’s similar in nature to AWS for Compute APIs, Twilio for Communications APIs, Stripe for Billing APIs. And now there is Pangea for Security APIs.

## Prerequisites

1. An Auth0 account and tenant. [Sign up for free](https://auth0.com/signup).

3. Save your Pangea token and Audit log ConfigId
